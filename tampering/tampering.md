# Tampering

This example demonstrates tampering through script injection.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

    `npm install`

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

    `npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, type a potentially malicious script in the name field of the form

    ```
        <script> document.body.innerHTML = "<a href='https://google.com'> Gotcha </a>"</script>
    ```

4. Do you see the potentially malicious hyperlink being injected into the form?

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts**
The main tampering vulnerability in `insecure.ts` is the ability for users to modify their session data without authentication. Since the `/register` endpoint sets `req.session.user` based purely on user input, an attacker can tamper with the session by submitting a privileged value like "Admin". This lets them access sensitive routes without any real verification. Although cookie settings are stricter (`httpOnly` and `sameSite: 'strict'`), the lack of input validation or role enforcement allows users to manipulate session state and escalate privileges, making the app vulnerable to logic tampering.

2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.
A malicious attacker can exploit the tampering vulnerability by submitting `"Admin"` in the registration form, which sets their session's `user` value to "Admin". Since the app checks only this session value to authorize access to the `/sensitive` route, the attacker can gain unauthorized access and perform privileged actions without real admin credentials or authentication. This lets them bypass access controls using simple input manipulation.

3. Briefly explain why **secure.ts** does not have the same vulnerabilties?
`secure.ts` avoids the vulnerabilities seen in `insecure.ts` by implementing key security measures. First, it sanitizes user input using `escapeHTML`, which prevents script injection and protects against XSS attacks. Second, the session cookie is set with `httpOnly: true` and `sameSite: 'strict'`, reducing the risk of session theft and CSRF attacks. While it still sets the `user` value from user input, the input is now cleaned, and the overall session configuration is more secureâ€”making it harder for an attacker to tamper with session data or exploit trust in raw input.
