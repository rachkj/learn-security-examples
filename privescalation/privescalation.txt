1. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

The privilege escalation vulnerability in `insecure.ts` occurs because it relies on user-submitted data (`userId` and `newRole`) without verifying the identity of the requester. Any user can claim to be an admin by submitting an `admin` userId and change roles, effectively bypassing authorization. The secure version fixes this by using session-based authentication. It checks the logged-in user's identity from the session (`req.session.userId`) and only allows role updates if that user exists and has the `admin` role. This ensures only authenticated and authorized admins can perform sensitive actions like updating user roles, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.


2. What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
- To strengthen security and prevent privilege escalation attacks, you can incorporate the following additional mechanisms:
- Proper Authentication: Use a secure login system with hashed passwords and session/token-based authentication to verify user identity.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement structured access control policies where only users with specific roles (like admin) can perform certain actions, regardless of input.
- Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent manipulation of critical fields like userId or role.
- Audit Logging: Log sensitive actions (e.g., role changes) with user IDs and timestamps to track unauthorized attempts and ensure accountability.
- Session Integrity Checks: Use secure, signed, and tamper-proof session cookies with short lifespans and automatic expiry on logout or inactivity.
