- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The vulnerability in insecure.ts is the lack of authentication and action logging, which allows users to send or access messages without verification or traceability. This enables repudiation, where users can deny having sent or accessed messages since there's no way to prove their involvement. In contrast, secure.ts includes request logging with timestamps and IP addresses, logs all key actions, and introduces a simulated authentication check. These measures ensure actions are traceable to specific users or IPs, making it much harder for malicious actors to deny their involvement.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
To further prevent repudiation attacks, you can implement proper user authentication (e.g., sessions, JWT tokens), include authenticated user IDs in logs, and digitally sign messages to verify authorship. Enforcing access controls ensures only authorized users can interact with the system, while using immutable, tamper-proof logging systems enhances accountability. These additional layers make it much more difficult for attackers to act anonymously or deny their actions.
